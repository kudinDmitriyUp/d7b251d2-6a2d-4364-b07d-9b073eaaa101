Whether you're launching a new product or refreshing your brand identity, I bring the same level of craft and attention to detail." },
                { question: "What's your availability like?", answer: "I typically take on 2–3 projects at a time to ensure each client gets my full attention. Reach out to check my current availability — I'm happy to discuss timelines." },
                { question: "Do you work remotely or on-site?", answer: "Primarily remote, but I'm open to on-site work for shoots, workshops, or strategy sessions depending on the project scope and location." },

                { question: "How do you structure your pricing?", answer: "I offer project-based pricing tailored to scope and deliverables. Every engagement starts with a discovery call so I can provide an accurate, transparent quote — no surprises." },
                { question: "Do you require a deposit?", answer: "Yes, I require a 50% deposit to secure your spot and begin work. The remaining balance is due upon delivery of final assets." },
                { question: "Do you offer retainer packages?", answer: "I do. For clients with ongoing creative needs, monthly retainers offer priority access, discounted rates, and faster turnaround times." },
                { question: "What's included in a typical project quote?", answer: "Quotes include all creative direction, production, editing, and delivery of final files. Revisions are built in — I want you to be thrilled with the result." },

                { question: "What does your process look like?", answer: "Discovery call → Creative brief → Concept development → Production → Review & refinement → Final delivery. I keep you in the loop at every stage with clear timelines and checkpoints." },
                { question: "How long does a typical project take?", answer: "Most projects wrap within 2–4 weeks depending on complexity. Larger campaigns or multi-deliverable projects may extend further, and I'll set expectations upfront." },
                { question: "How many revisions are included?", answer: "Two rounds of revisions are standard. In practice, my clients rarely need more than one — I invest heavily in understanding your vision before production begins." },

                { question: "Do you track performance metrics?", answer: "While I focus on the creative, I design everything with performance in mind. I'm happy to collaborate with your marketing team to align on KPIs and measure impact." },
